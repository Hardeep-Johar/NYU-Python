## Programming in Python (Spring 2016)
###Objective
The goal of this class is to give you a working knowledge of how to write computer programs, to get data from the web, and to build your own web applications. We'll learn the basic elements of programming through the language **Python**. At the end of this class, you can expect to be fairly proficient in using Python to build applications, understand enough about programming to be able to quickly pick up other languages (particularly scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby or Perl), and have a good understanding of what it takes to plan, analyze, design, implement and support software applications. We'll tour **Python libraries for data analysis** and, finally, we’ll put all these components together to learn how to **crawl the web for data** and to **build web apps**. 

Your reward, at the end of the course (assuming you do everything seriously!) will be substantial. You’ll understand how computer applications  - large scale ones or small scale ones - work and you’ll be able to build working prototypes to illustrate and market your own ideas. But, be aware that this is an intensive course that will require a lot of work and a substantial time commitment. 

###Who should you take this course?
Frankly, everyone. Computer programs are ubiquitous in our modern world - how many times have you looked at your phone in the last five minutes :) The amount of data available on the Internet is huge and most of it remains relatively untapped.
