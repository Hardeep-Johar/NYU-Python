###Who should take this course
Frankly, everyone! We live in an information age, surrounded by data and with computer programs popping up around us all the time. If you want to move effectively through this information space you need to understand what programming is all about. By the end of this class, not only will you be able to talk to computer geeks you have to deal with at work, but you will also be able to design and build prototype applications. If, while gazing at your smartphone or surfing the web, you have ever thought "why hasn't someone done that, you'll have the tools to make it happen!
###You've had no exposure to programming?
Though we cover a lot of ground, we start at point zero so no prior programming experience is required or even necessary. All you need is the desire to learn and a willingness to work hard. Come with those two prerequisites and you will be surprised how delightfully fulfilling it can be to build applications.
